# Mixing times

Here we apply the channel $\mathcal F$ for various values of $\lambda$ and for open boundary conditions. $\lambda$ mixes us between our original $\mathcal E$ channel and its CZ conjugated version. 
The difference between $\mathcal F$ and $\mathcal E$ is that $\mathcal F$ is a random architecture. That is, at each time step, we randomly choose a qudit, and then apply $\mathcal E_j$ on it.

We perform the simulation and store create the data in `data_io.py`. We then analyze the data in `analyze_data.ipynb`.


**To do**: describe the difference between this folder and the mixingtime2.0 folder.
